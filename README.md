This is not meant as a commercial game, just for a fun project.
None of the assets are used in a commercial setting.

A clone of StanislavPetrovV Wolfenstien 3D clone (https://github.com/StanislavPetrovV/Wolfenstein-3D-Clone) Slightly edited with other features but retains the same/similar code. Licence can be found within the repository! 

Added intermission screens for when the level ends.
More keys are added replacing keycards.
Melee weapons are added such as chainsaws
God mode and level fog.
